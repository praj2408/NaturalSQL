# Text-to-SQL Copilot
Text-to-SQL Copilot is a tool to support users who see SQL databases as a barrier to actionable insights. Taking your natural language question as input, it uses a generative text model to write a SQL statement based on your data model. Then runs it on your database and analyses the results. And it does this all at no cost using HuggingFace Inference API.
